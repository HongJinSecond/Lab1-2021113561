Crunchy, sweet, and packed with delicious candied strawberries, my version of the Northern Chinese tanghulu is low-effort, high-impact cooking at its finest. Enjoy a strawberry tanghulu or make other candied fruit. And while I canâ€™t whisk you to China for a taste of covered tonghulu, I can introduce you to my tanghulu recipe.
happy tall man, happy short man.
